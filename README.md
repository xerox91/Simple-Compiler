Simple-Compiler
===============

Sergio Salomon Garcia, *sergio.salomon at alumnos.unican.es*

A **simple compiler construction using PLY** for the grammar 5.1 defined in the 
book "Basics of Compiler Design" (Torben AE. Mogensen). 
This grammar corresponds to a functional language similar to ML.
From this grammar, had been deduced the tokens for the *lexer*.

At the moment, it only has the lexical and syntax analysis (parsing).
As time goes by, there will be implemented the remaining phases of
compilation.


*Notice: there's some shift/reduce conflicts in the grammar to be fixed soon.*
